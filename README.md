# hello-world
- Hi, I’m Cristian Milanes
- I’m interested in computer hardware/software design, programming, and electronics 
- I’m currently learning the C and C++ programming language
- I'm originally from Hawaii
- I'm a SOPHOMORE in computer engineering 
- I chose my major because I felt it would mesh my interests in physical engineering design and programming
- A fun fact about me is: I'm somewhat ambidextrous
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn more intricacies of C/C++,programming stragtegies, and familiarize myself more with the craft.  
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Everything Everywhere All at Once
